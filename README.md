Capstone Project - The Battle of the Neighborhoods
Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM/Coursera

# Introduction: Business Problem

In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a restuarant. In particular for this project we will try to find an optimal location for an Italian Restaurant in Manhattan,NY.

Since there are a lot of restaurants in and around the many neighborhoods of Manhattan,NY we will try to find locations where there aren't that many restaurants and in particular only a few Italian restaurants in the vicinity.

We will use our data science powers to generate a few promising locations based on this criteria. Advantages of each one will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.
