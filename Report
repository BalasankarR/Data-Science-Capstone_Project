Introduction/Business Problem

In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a restuarant.In particular for this project we will try to find an optimal location for an Italian Restaurant in
Manhattan,NY. Since there are a lot of restaurants in and around the many neighborhoods of Manhattan,NY we will try to find locations where there aren't that many restaurants 
and in particular only a few Italian restaurants in the vicinity. We will use our data science powers to generate a few promising locations based on this criteria. Advantages of 
each one will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.

Data

Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are:
* number of existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant).
* number of and distance to Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, if any.
* distance from neighborhood(By taking the Latitude and Longitude values of the neighbourhood as its center). 

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:
* centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Maps API reverse geocoding.
* number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API.
